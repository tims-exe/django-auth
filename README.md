# Authentication in Django

This project is a simple Django app where I focused on implementing user authentication. I set up features like user registration, login, and logout. It’s all about creating a secure way for users to sign up and access their accounts. The goal was to learn how to use Django’s built-in authentication system and apply it to real-world projects. It's a small but important step toward building more complex apps with proper user management.
